<p>Honorable [MP_NAME],

My name is [FULL_NAME] and I am a Canadian Azeri and I am advocating for the rights of Azeri ethnic minority in Iran. Azeris include 25%-35% of Iran's population and our language is banned in schools and offices in Iran. Islamic Republic of Iran is implementing discriminatory economic, environmental and cultural policies against Azeri Turkic population.

Unfortunately, talking about ethnic minority rights is a taboo among Iran’s opposition and journalists. Most of them are against ethnic minority rights in Iran. For instance, son of the ex-king of Iran, who is leading the Persian opposition, released a video 2 week ago and asked Iran's government to deal with Iran's ethnic minorities by sending police force to suppress them. We do not have a voice. Our voice is concealed by Persian journalists who believe that hiding ethnic issues in Iran is their biggest duty. Also, we do not have access to medias that are funded by taxpayers in Western democracies to promote Western values, provide a reliable and authoritative source of news and create a soft power for our country. US. and United Kingdom provided broadcasting ability for Iranian opposition outside Iran, but Persian journalists formed a mafia in those medias, and they are preventing journalists related to ethnic movement of Azeris from working in VOA Iran, Radio Farda, and BBC Farsi to cover issues that are the most important for Azeri people and other ethnicities in the country. This prevents that these medias from conveying the message intended to send by our Western countries diplomatic organization. 

<strong>About Iran:</strong>
Ethnic Persian, which is 35-45% of the country's population, have full control of the power inside Iran and the rest of none-Persian population which includes ethnic minorities Azeri, Kurd, Arab, Baluch, Turkmen are not having any self-governance or cultural rights. 
Islamic republic of Iran is recruiting its supporters based on Shiite religion and Persian nationalism. 

<strong>What can be done:</strong>
1) Having hearing about ethnic minorities in Iran in house of commons committees about ethnic issue of Azeris in Iran
2) Reports and Statements from the Government of Canada in support of ethnic minority rights in Iran and releasing monthly video reports on the situation of ethnic minorities in Iran
3) Suggesting changes to Iranian government for improving and accommodating ethnic minority rights in Iran through ambassador Bob Rae in UN. 
4) Allocating 2 hours per day program in Radio CBC international to promote multiculturalism and federal democracy in Iran and educate people of Iran about federal system experience in countries like Canada, Switzerland, Belgium and India's in Farsi.
5) Providing 2 hours Satellite TV program in Azeri for 20-30 million ethnic minority Azeri in Iran, who do not have any class or media in their own mother language.
6) Providing bursary and funds for Azeri ethnic movement in Iran to educate young generation of Azeri scholars in human sciences field.
7) Providing fund for ethnic Azeri movement in Iran to create organizations and centers to directly empower ethnic movement in Azeri provinces of Iran in the North West of the country (East Azerbaijan, West Azerbaijan, Ardabil, Zanjan, Qazvin, Hamadan, Alborz, and Tehran)
8) Consistent consulting with figurers of ethnic Azeri movement in Iran about Canada’s policy about Iran
